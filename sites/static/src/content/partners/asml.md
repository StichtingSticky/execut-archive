**ASML is changing the world, one nanometer at a time! We’re a high-tech, Netherlands-based company manufacturing complex lithography systems that chipmakers use to produce integrated circuits aka microchips.**

Our machines help create the electronics you use in your daily life. In the past three decades, we have grown from a startup to a multinational company with over 60 locations globally and annual net sales of €18.6 billion in 2021.

Behind ASML’s innovation hides true talent. Our researchers, engineers, scientists and manufacturing specialists, as well as our high-tech hardware and software experts, make the impossible happen every day.

We invest around €2.5 billion per year in R&D, giving our teams the freedom, support and resources to experiment, test and push the boundaries of technology. They work in close-knit, multidisciplinary teams, learning and growing along with the company.
