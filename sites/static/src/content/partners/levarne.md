Accelerating digital innovation, that is our mission here at Levarne. Whether it’s creating a dynamic accreditation system for logistics management for the Formule 1 Dutch Grand Prix Zandvoort, optimizing advertising behavior on an e-Commerce tool for the biggest drugstore in the Netherlands, or creating the infrastructure and code for (international) Cash machines.

The impact we create is generated in an inspiring environment where there’s room for own initiative and personal development. We are independent, constantly pushing our creative boundaries, celebrating special milestones and strive to always be micro-ambitious.

Are you coming to work here? As soon as you enter Levarne you immediately feel the informal, cozy atmosphere. You can see this in the way we greet and treat each other. You can always count on colleagues who are not only ready to help customers, but are also happy to offer their colleagues a helping hand. Collaboration is key and succeeding together is one of our core values. Together we achieve the best results.

Want to relax during a busy day? That's always possible! We are very fanatic when it comes to soccer, artistic drawings, 'saucijzenbroodjes' and LEGO. In addition, we never skip the 'Foute Uur' and we organize game parties, knowledge sessions and (sports)clinics.
