BPM Company started in 2011 as the first Pega partner in the Netherlands, based on the conviction that software can be built in a better and more effective way. Since then we have fully developed ourselves as an organization and actively contributed to the Pega ecosystem in the Benelux.

By building innovative software with Pega, we optimize and automate business-critical processes and help our customers improve their customer satisfaction or sales. And one thing is for sure, the impact our consultants have is enormous!

Not the biggest, but the best! That's what we're going for. So we like to challenge each other to be and remain the best and therefore invest in our people from the first day.

Working with us means working at a family like organization where you as a colleague are central and where we like to organize great events. Will you join one of our BBQs, ski trip or one of our other events soon?
