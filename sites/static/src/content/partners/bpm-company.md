BPM Company is an IT organization based in Utrecht. We specialize in automating and optimizing business processes and have been doing so for our clients for 13 years. Typically, these involve end-to-end processes that transcend multiple departments within an organization, resulting in a high degree of dynamism and complexity. As a result, our consultants have a significant impact on the business operations of our clients within the top-500 segment, including companies like Rabobank, ING, Transavia, LeasePlan, and De Mandemakers Groep.

We implement our solutions using the innovative software platform Pega. This platform allows both visual modeling (low code) and building functionalities (high code) yourself. Consequently, Pega offers endless possibilities and enables the rapid development of applications.

Due to our clear quality vision, we pay a lot of attention to the personal and technical development of our colleagues. Additionally, we value the sense of family and organize several enjoyable company events annually, alongside our weekly Friday afternoon drinks.
