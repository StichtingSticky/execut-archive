With Social Extended Reality (XR) emerging as a new medium, where users can remotely experience immersive content with others, the vision of a true feeling of 'being there together' has become a realistic goal. This keynote will provide an overview about the challenges to achieve such a goal, based on results from practical case studies like the TRANSMIXR (https://transmixr.eu) and MediaScape XR (https://youtu.be/zzB7B6EAU9c) projects. We will discuss about different technologies, like point clouds, that can be used as the format for representing highly-realistic digital humans, and about metrics and protocols for quantifying the quality of experience. The final intention of the talk is to shed some light on social XR, as a new group of virtual reality experiences based on social photorealistic immersive content. We will discuss about the challenges regarding production and user-centric processes, and discover the new opportunities open by this new medium.
