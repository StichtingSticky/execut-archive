Playful Digital User Experiences: what does it take to create more than the sum of its team members.

Developing playful digital products is an interesting journey. It takes a multidisciplinary team of developers, visual designers, game designers etc. to produce them. How to translate an assignment into a valuable user experience but also create a maintainable, flexible and affordable software solution? How to utilise creativity and expertise from all team members? How to validate initial assumptions?

In this talk, I will show you how we at IJsfontein handle this dynamic, illustrated with case studies and our approach and process. I'd like to share my insights from a technical perspective on how rewarding and sometimes challenging our field of work can be.
