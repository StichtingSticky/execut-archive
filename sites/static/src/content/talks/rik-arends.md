The fun of programming: What happens when we stop wasting compute time and enjoying how fast our computers really are. Most programming is done with interpreted languages nowadays cutting people off from writing their own high performance code. If you do anything related to audio, video or graphics you want speed. Until recently you had to program C++ to do this. However now we have a new language: Rust that can enable anyone to go fast again. In this talk i will show fractals, synthesisers and very fast UI code and why this makes programming fun again.
