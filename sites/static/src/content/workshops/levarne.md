title: Knowledge session with Levarne
time: '14:15'
---

At Levarne we organize knowledge sessions a couple times a year. In this workshop you’ll get a glimpse of how we like to extend our knowledge in a fun, interactive and dynamic way.

In this workshop we explain about our way of working and together we’ll face a real digital challenge that we encountered in our project for the Formule 1 Dutch Grand Prix Zandvoort. We will challenge you by filling in the gaps in some of our code and really have a critical look at which steps are required when building a native app. Experience with git (and ionic) would be a big plus for participation.

In this workshop you will learn more about the first steps in app development. Eager for more depth, we also have a hand-out available at the end of the workshop to finish off the code for yourselves. After which you are very welcome to share about your experience with it and visit one of our real knowledge sessions in the office!
