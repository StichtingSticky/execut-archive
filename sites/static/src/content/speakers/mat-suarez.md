My name is Mat Suarez, I'm from Texas and I've been living in the Netherlands for 3 years. I am an Associate Technical Art Director at EA, as a part of a central tools team. In this role I partner with some of EA's largest franchises, such as FIFA, Madden, Battlefield, and Need for Speed, to design and develop technical solutions which empower content creators to achieve their vision. My passion and specialization are in procedural tools and creating efficient and intuitive workflows.
