I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Information and Computing Sciences of Utrecht University. I am passionate about Graphs, Algorithms and Data Visualizations. I love beauty in all its forms â€“ whether it is nature, art or design. I am intrigued by psychology and the dynamics of human relationships. My goal in life is to use all my skills to make this world a little better place to live.
