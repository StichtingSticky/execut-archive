Welcome to the sixth edition of exec(ut)! The committee and I are really excited for you all to be here in Nieuwegein with us. We have worked tirelessly to put this awesome day filled with talks, workshops, networking opportunities and of course food and drinks together. Whether you are a student, speaker or a company we hope you enjoy this years edition.

Whatever your main reason is to join us today, we are sure you will have a great time at the conference. Whether it is a hopefully inspiring talk about responsible Image Generation or how procedural content creation is used for creating games. Maybe you are more excited for one of the three workshops if you were lucky enough to get a spot. Like the real world problem encountered during the F1 Cup in Zandvoort by Levarne. If the talks and workshops are not enough you will have plenty of time to ask questions during the question rounds or during the networking periods. 

Last year I was able to get my internship through networking at exec(ut) so it could definitely be a helpful tool to get a place to write a thesis or a new job.

I canâ€™t wait to see you all, have fun!
